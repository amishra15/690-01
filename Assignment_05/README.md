# Summary
What is Data Analysis?<br/>
A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.<br/><br/>
Why Python for Data Analysis?<br/>
- very simple and intuitive to learn
- "correct" language"
- powerful libraries
- free and open source<br/>

## Data Anaysis Process
Data Extraction -> Data Cleaning -> Data Wrangling -> Analysis -> Action <br/>

## Most important and common libraries
- Pandas (for data manipulation and dataframes)
- Numpy (to handle large datasets, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
- Matplotlib (to plot visual graphs)

### Pandas<br/>
- most important library for data analysis
- ~ not, | or, & and
- use df.describe to get the summary of the statistics
- df.dtypes to get dataset
- to import -> import pandas as pd <br/>
df = pd.read_csv('path.csv', low_memory=False)

### Numpy
- most important library for data processing
- use numpy.int to specify the bits
- its great to work with arrays
- summary statistics can also be used here<br/> ex: a.sum(), a.mean() etc
- useful numpy function -> random, arrange, reshape, linspace

### Matplotlib
- use subplot() to generate subplots
- legend() can be used to modify legend
